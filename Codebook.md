The minimum for a codebook for this project is to 
1) copy over the feature_info.txt, 
2) remove all columns that have been removed, 
3) rename the columns that have been renamed, and 
4) state the transformation. 

Yes, this is going to repeat information in the raw data folder. 
Your graders aren't looking in the raw data folder to grade you, they are looking for a file called codebook.md. 
Make it easy for them. If there isn't a file or it isn't named correctly, they will not have an easy time giving points.

Yes, the codebook should mention whether the data table is long or wide, and anything else to do with the organization of the variables.

No, details of the code should be in comments in the code or in the README.md. A short rule is that things to do with the code or how to run it go in the README, things that describe the variables go in the codebook.
